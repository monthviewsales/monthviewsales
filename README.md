## 👋 About Me  
I’m Scooby ([@ScoobyCarolan](https://x.com/ScoobyCarolan)) — Senior Integration Engineer with 20+ years in system architecture, automation, and supply-chain integrations.  
By day I build scalable integrations and APIs.  
By night I operate in the trenches of **Solana** — engineering survival software and relics unearthed from **VAULT77 🔐77**.
